# Digital Banking Full-Stack

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A complete full-stack web application that simulates a modern digital banking platform. This project features a secure, token-based REST API backend built with Java (Spring Boot) and a responsive, interactive frontend built with React (Vite).

It includes separate functionalities for standard users (account management, transactions) and a dedicated admin panel for administrative tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features

This application is divided into two main roles, each with its own set of capabilities:

### **User Features**
* **Authentication:** Secure user registration and JWT (JSON Web Token) based login.
* **Account Dashboard:** View account balance, account number, and user details.
* **Transaction History:** A complete, paginated list of all past transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
* **Core Banking Actions:**
    * **Deposit:** Add funds to an account.
    * **Withdraw:** Remove funds from an account.
    * **Transfer:** Send money to another user's account.
* **Dispute/Rollback Requests:** Users can submit a request to an admin to review or roll back a specific transaction.

### **Admin Features**
* **Secure Admin Dashboard:** A separate, protected route and dashboard for all administrative actions.
* **User Management:** Search for users and manage their accounts.
* **View All Transactions:** Access to the complete transaction history for all users on the platform.
* **Transaction Rollback Queue:** View and process user-submitted requests for transaction rollbacks.

## 💻 Tech Stack

This project is a monorepo containing two separate applications:

### **Backend (The "Engine")**
* **Java 17**
* **Spring Boot 3:** The core application framework.
* **Spring Security 6:** For handling all authentication, authorization, and security.
* **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate):** For database interaction (Object-Relational Mapping).
* **MySQL:** The relational database for storing all user and transaction data.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For stateless, token-based security.
* **Maven:** For project and dependency management.

### **Frontend (The "Face")**
* **React:** The core UI library.
* **Vite:** A high-speed build tool and development server.
* **React Router:** For client-side routing and page navigation.
* **React Context API:** For global state management (e.g., managing user's login status).
* **Axios / Fetch:** For making API calls to the Spring Boot backend.
* **CSS Modules:** For component-level, scoped styling.
